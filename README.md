# JWT_project

A project to practice authentication with JWT. In the backend of the application, I used Node.js along with Express, and for the database, I used MongoDB. To test the API, don't forget to start the local server. A tool I recommend is Postman, where you can make your requests in the best possible way!

Please note: Create a .env file (using the dotenv library in JavaScript) to store your secret key and establish a connection to a database. We use dotenv for environment variables and do not push it to Git for security reasons, to avoid sharing sensitive data. Thank you for your understanding!
